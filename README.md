"Decipher" refers to the process of interpreting, understanding, or translating something that is difficult to understand. It involves solving or decoding hidden messages in encrypted information. Decipher is an engaging segment where one must think not only critically but also strategically. One should be wise enough to know what to look for. Participants have to discover the messages hidden in the ciphers and thus strategy is key. Participants will be judged on the basis of how many messages they could figure out and how complex the encrypted version was .
