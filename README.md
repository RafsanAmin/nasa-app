Our project features an immersive web-based interactive game designed to boost students' ocean and atmospheric literacy through engaging exploration of PACE data.

In this game, players embark on two distinct journeys: Map Ocean and Map Cloud. Each journey unfolds across multiple levels, where players encounter prompts that vividly introduce them to the NASA PACE project.

These prompts provide essential data needed to tackle challenges and progress through the levels. As players navigate through the game, they must leverage the provided data to overcome obstacles and advance.

Upon completing the game, participants receive a comprehensive game report detailing their performance. This report highlights the data which are successfully utilized and identifies areas for improvement, and then this report will be added to the leaderboards.

Our website also includes a dedicated webpage featuring the PACE project profile, offering valuable insights for students, educators, researchers, and the general public. In that webpage, we are including study materials on key scientific topics like Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs), the carbon cycle, and how aerosols and clouds affect our climate. Weâ€™ll be regularly updating the content to stay in sync with the latest discoveries from the PACE mission! This resource will support further learning and inspire future projects related to the NASA mission.
