    title: 'HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS',
    desc: 'These are Algae. When they increase in number rapidly, it’s called algal bloom. Normally, algae are helpful because they make food and oxygen for fish and other water creatures, JUST LIKE TREES!  When this happens, they are called good algae blooms, also known as non-harmful algae blooms. But when they harm our water friends, they are called harmful algae blooms (HABs).',
