            Let’s take a fun trip with carbon dioxide (CO2) as it travels through the ocean! On this
            adventure, CO2 will meet some tiny ocean friends like phytoplankton and zooplankton, and
            we’ll see how it moves around to help keep our planet healthy. Ready? Let’s dive in! Our
            journey starts when CO2 from the air gets absorbed by the ocean. In fact, about one
            fourth (25%) of all human-made CO2 ends up in the ocean!

            There, we meet phytoplankton—tiny, plant-like creatures that live in the sunny upper
            part of the ocean, called the surface layer. Just like trees on land, phytoplankton use
            sunlight to photosynthesize, which means they take in CO2 and turn it into food. This
            helps them grow and release oxygen, which is super important for us to breathe. In fact,
            phytoplankton produce about half of the oxygen we breathe. That means every second
            breath you take is thanks to these tiny ocean plants!

          <h3>Zooplankton – The Carbon Movers</h3> But phytoplankton don’t stay alone for long. Tiny
          creatures called zooplankton come along and eat them, and when they do, the carbon inside
          the phytoplankton gets passed along to the zooplankton. Zooplankton are like tiny ocean
          animals that carry carbon on its next big adventure. Zooplankton then get eaten by small
          fish, and those fish might get eaten by even bigger animals like whales. So, as each
          creature eats another, the carbon gets passed along the food chain—from one animal to
          another. It’s like a relay race, where carbon keeps moving along through the ocean!

          <h3>Down, Down, Down – The Big Sink</h3> Eventually, some of the phytoplankton and
          zooplankton die. When they do, their bodies start to sink to the bottom of the ocean. This
          is called the biological pump—it’s like a giant elevator that moves carbon down to the
          deep ocean. But that’s not all! When animals like zooplankton poop, that poop also sinks,
          taking more carbon with it. The deeper the carbon goes, the better it’s locked away. Down
          there in the dark, carbon stays hidden for hundreds or even thousands of years. It’s like
          storing treasure at the bottom of the sea!

        <p>
          <h3>The Twilight Zone – Where the Magic Happens</h3> But wait—there’s more! Some
          zooplankton are big adventurers. At night, they swim up to the surface to eat
          phytoplankton, and when the sun rises, they dive back down into the twilight zone. This is
          a deep part of the ocean where it’s dark and mysterious. As they swim up and down, they
          carry carbon with them, helping it sink even deeper. This helps keep the carbon out of the
          atmosphere, which is important for keeping the planet cool.

          <h3>Step 5: What If Carbon Stays Near the Surface?</h3> Not all carbon makes it to the
          deep ocean, though. Sometimes, if phytoplankton and zooplankton get eaten near the
          surface, the carbon they have can escape back into the air. But when carbon sinks into the
          deep ocean, it stays there, far away from the atmosphere. That’s why it’s so important for
          carbon to sink—so it doesn’t come back up!

          <h3>Long-Term Storage – Carbon’s New Home</h3> Once the carbon is deep in the ocean, it’s
          like it found a new home. It stays down there for a long, long time, far away from the
          atmosphere. This helps keep Earth’s climate cool and makes sure there’s not too much CO2
          in the air. The ocean is like a giant storage locker for carbon, and it helps protect our
          planet. Since humans started burning fossil fuels, the ocean has absorbed about 30% of all
          the extra CO2 we’ve put into the air. That’s why the ocean is such an important part of
          the carbon cycle!

          So, how do scientists know all this? Well, NASA has a special spacecraft called PACE that
          watches the ocean from space! It looks at the ocean’s color, which changes when
          phytoplankton are present. By watching these colors, PACE helps scientists see where
          phytoplankton are, how much CO2 they’re taking in, and how the carbon is moving through
          the ocean. It’s like having a superhero watch over the ocean’s carbon adventure from
          space! (animated superhero astronaut)
