            These are Algae. When they increase in number rapidly, it’s called algal bloom.
            Normally, algae are helpful because they make food and oxygen for fish and other water
            creatures, JUST LIKE TREES! When this happens, they are called good algae blooms, also
            known as non-harmful algae blooms. But when they harm our water friends, they are called
            harmful algae blooms (HABs).

            Harmful Algal Blooms, or HABs, happen when tiny plants in the water called algae grow
            too much and make the water unsafe. Some of these algae produce poisons that can make
            fish, animals, and even people sick.<br></br> The water can change color, like turning
            green, red, or brown, and sometimes it smells bad. If people or animals touch or drink
            this water, it can make them sick by causing stomachaches, rashes, or other problems.

          <b>HABs may be caused for the following reasons:</b>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Just like humans need food, algae also need food to grow. Their foods are organic food
              molecules from carbon di oxide and sunlight. They also take in nitrogen, phosphorus,
              carbon, silica and other micronutrients. Sometimes, there’s too much food in the
              water, like extra nutrients from fertilizer used on farms or in gardens. These
              nutrients, like nitrogen and phosphorus, get washed into rivers, lakes, or oceans when
              it rains. With so much extra food, algae grow much faster than normal, causing an
              algal bloom. This results in HABs. (Rain picture animated, farmer picture)
            </li>
            <li>
              Algae love warm water. Algae grow faster in warmer water, so when the weather gets hot
              or the water heats up, it helps the algae grow more than usual. This is why algal
              blooms are more common in summer when the temperatures are higher.
            </li>
            <li>
              Algae can bloom more easily when the water isn’t moving much. Like in a pond or a
              lake, algae can grow faster because they’re not being washed away by waves or
              currents.
            </li>
            <li>
              Like all plants, algae need sunlight to grow. If the water is shallow or clear,
              sunlight can reach the algae, helping them grow faster. Blooms often happen near the
              surface, where there’s plenty of light.

          <b>
            Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) can cause a lot of problems for both people and animals.
            Here are some of the main impacts:
          </b>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Water Unsafe:</b>
              <br></br> Some algae in harmful blooms produce poisons, which can make the water
              dangerous to drink, swim in, or even touch. If people or animals come into contact
              with the water, they can get sick, with things like stomachaches, rashes, or breathing
              problems.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Create oxygen shortage:</b> <br></br>Like most plants, many algae produce oxygen
              during the daylight as a by-product of photosynthesis. At night these algae consume
              oxygen but not as much as the oxygen they produced. When they are in huge number, the
              algae use up all the oxygen in the water, so fish and other creatures don’t have
              enough to breathe. Some animals can also eat the algae and get poisoned.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Smelly Water:</b> <br></br>Harmful algal blooms can make the water smell really
              bad. As the algae grow and die, they give off a strong, unpleasant odor, which can
              make it hard for people to enjoy being near the water.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Blocks sunlight:</b> <br></br>When HABs take over, they block sunlight from
              reaching underwater plants. This can harm the plants and other animals that rely on
              those plants for food and shelter.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Affects Fishing and Swimming:</b>
              <br></br> If there’s a harmful algal bloom, people can’t go fishing or swimming
              because the water is unsafe. This can also hurt businesses, like fishers who rely on
              clean water to catch fish.

          <b>Few ways to help stop or reduce harmful algal blooms (HABs) and keep water safe:</b>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Use Less Fertilizer:</b>
              <br></br> Farmers and gardeners can use less fertilizer on their crops and lawns.
              Since fertilizers contain nutrients that feed algae, using less helps stop algae from
              growing too fast.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>eep Water Clean:</b>
              <br></br> People can help by making sure trash, chemicals, and sewage don’t get into
              rivers, lakes, or oceans. Keeping water clean helps prevent algae from getting too
              much food.{' '}
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Plant Trees and Plants Near Water:</b>
              <br></br> Plants and trees help soak up extra nutrients before they get into the
              water. Planting them along rivers, lakes, or ponds can reduce the chance of algal
              blooms.{' '}
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Pick Up Pet Waste:</b>
              <br></br> When it rains, pet waste can wash into lakes and rivers, adding extra
              nutrients to the water that help algae grow. Picking up after pets helps keep these
              nutrients out of the water.{' '}
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Monitor Water Quality:</b>
              <br></br> Scientists can watch the water carefully using tools like NASA PACE
              Spacecraft to detect algal blooms early. If they know when a bloom is starting, they
              can take action faster to reduce its impact.
