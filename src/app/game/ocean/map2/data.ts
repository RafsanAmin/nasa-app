    title: 'The Summer Mystery',
    question:
      'It’s a hot July day near the Gulf of Mexico! The ocean looks reddish-brown, and fishermen can’t find any fish. People on the beach are coughing and sneezing. The sample collected is found to have toxins called brevetoxins . What’s the possible phytoplankton?',
    correct: 3,
    options: ['Diatoms', 'Coccolithophores', 'Karenia brevis', 'Glacial flour'],
    cause:
      'This tiny algae causes red tides, which can make the water look red and release toxins that harm fish and people.',
  },
  green: {
    title: 'The Spring Awakening',
    question:
      'The cold water of Southern Ocean is  seen turning bright green as the sun is finally shining over! Fish are harder to catch, and the ocean is full of life. The sample seems to contain silica. What is making the water so green?',
    correct: 1,
    options: ['Diatoms', 'Karenia brevis', 'Dissolved organic matter (DOC)', 'Prochlorococcus'],
    cause:
      'These tiny plant-like organisms love cold, nutrient-rich water. When they bloom, they turn the ocean green and produce oxygen, which helps other ocean creatures.',
  },

    title: 'The Glacial Secret',
    question:
      'In late summer, glaciers in Barents sea are melting and making the water look cloudy and turquoise. This grayish powder called glacial flour is mixing into the ocean. A sample where brought in lab and after examining, we have found traces of calcium carbonate. What does this mean for the tiny ocean plants?',
    correct: 3,
    options: ['Karenia brevis', 'Diatoms', 'Coccolithophores', 'Dissolved organic matter (DOC)'],
    cause:
      'They thrive in nutrient-rich waters and create beautiful blooms that can help feed small fish and other creatures while also absorbing carbon dioxide. They’re covered in tiny, shiny armor plates made of calcium carbonate – kind of like seashells',
  },
  brown: {
    title: 'The Winter Blues',
    question:
      'You went on a vacation and you notice the lake near you looks murky and brown. The fish aren’t biting, and everyone is confused. What could be causing this cloudy water?',
    correct: 2,
    options: ['Diatoms', 'Dissolved organic matter (DOC)', 'Prochlorococcus', 'Glacial flour'],
    cause:
      'As plants and animals break down in the water, DOC can make it look murky. It provides food for tiny water creatures but can change the water’s quality.',
  },
  blue: {
    title: 'The Winter Blues',
    question:
      'The nutrition poor, warm, tropical Mediterranean water looks bright green! Marine biologists are curious about the change. The sample suggests that they are probably the smallest photosynthetic organism. What’s going on under the waves?',
    correct: 4,
    options: ['Coccolithophores', 'Karenia brevis', 'Glacial flour', 'Prochlorococcus'],
    cause:
      'This tiny cyanobacteria loves warm, sunny waters and thrives in low-nutrient areas, helping to produce oxygen and supporting the marine food web.',
  },
  white: {
    title: 'The Mystery of the Turquoise Waters',
    question:
      'It’s early June, and some scientists are exploring a river that flows from a melting glacier in Greenland. The water is a stunning turquoise color and feels cool to the touch. As thy look closer, they notice a fine, powdery substance settling on the riverbed. They assume that this powder can help tiny ocean plants grow.',
    correct: 2,
    options: [
      'Karenia brevis',
      'Glacial flour',
      'Coccolithophores',
      'Dissolved organic matter (DOC)',
    ],
    cause:
      'The fine, powdery substance is made up of tiny particles created when glaciers grind against rocks. This glacial flour contains essential nutrients, especially iron, which helps phytoplankton bloom in the ocean. The turquoise color indicates that the water is rich in these nutrients, making it a perfect home for tiny ocean plants like coccolithophores, which are vital for ocean health!',
